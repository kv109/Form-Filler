*Configuration*
Form inputs are being filled with values you set in Options Page. 
You set those values for specific input types, for example login or email. You can also define your own type. 
Each type can have more than one value assigned.

*How it works*
Form Filler tries to determine if a given form input matches types you set values for. If so, dblclick on this input fills it with the assigned value. If there is more than one value set for matched type, another dblclick switches between them.
Inputs can be also filled totally automatically if the proper option in configuration is checked.

*Synchronization*
All values but passwords are synchronized between Google Chrome browsers you use. (Chrome must be connected with your Google account.)
